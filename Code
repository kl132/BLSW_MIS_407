Problem:

How have different types of energy increased or decreased throughout the years?  
  -	Possible Future Options: 
    o	Store as var emissions for energy types and plot the CO2 emissions throughout the years
      •	Y: emissions
      •	X: years
    o	Pull another data source to analyze CO2 emissions based on a set population per year (WE HAVE NOT FOUND THIS DATA SOURCE)
      •	Y: emissions
      •	X: years
      •	Plot each data source vs. each other

Process to Solve our Question:
'''
#We cannot groupby anything

#The plot would mostly benefit from a line graph possibly a pie chart
    #Plot using pandas or seaborn

#We need a df to analyze energy usage of a type vs the total amount consumed per year
    #Index by date?


#Average energy used for entire years then index by year
    #new column possibly?

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sb
#Open the data source

energy = pd.read_excel('/Users/tombrix/Desktop/Fall 2015/Group Project 407/Energy.xlsx')

df = pd.DataFrame(energy)
print(df)


#energy.plot(bins = 35, kind = 'line', subplots = True)

Problem:

How have different types of energy increased or decreased throughout the years?  
  -	Possible Future Options: 
    o	Store as var emissions for energy types and plot the CO2 emissions throughout the years
      •	Y: emissions
      •	X: years
    o	Pull another data source to analyze CO2 emissions based on a set population per year (WE HAVE NOT FOUND THIS DATA SOURCE)
      •	Y: emissions
      •	X: years
      •	Plot each data source vs. each other
'''

'''
Process to Solve our Question:
'''
#We cannot groupby anything

#The plot would mostly benefit from a line graph possibly a pie chart
    #Plot using pandas or seaborn

#We need a df to analyze energy usage of a type vs the total amount consumed per year
    #Index by date?


#Average energy used for entire years then index by year
    #new column possibly?

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sb
#Open the data source

energy = pd.read_excel('/Users/tombrix/Desktop/Fall 2015/Group Project 407/Energy.xlsx')

df = pd.DataFrame(energy)
#print(df)


x = df['Month']
nuclearPower = df['Nuclear Electric Power Production']
fossilPower = df['Total Fossil Fuels Production']
renewablePower = df['Total Renewable Energy Production']
#Possibly use totalPower to define each of the powers as a % of a pie plot?
totalPower = df['Total Primary Energy Production']

Averaging columns

Averaging the columns is the difficulty:
We are unable to pull values from the loop to average the 
12 values for each month (a whole year)...




'''
avg=0
nuclearList=[] #declaring the list for values
print('Averaging the Values: ')
for i in nuclearPower: #all rows needs to be at the end i=i +12
    if i >= 24: #Likely issue
    
        for num in range(0,12):# averaging the values is this loop's purpose for nuclear
            avg += nuclearPower[i+num] #adding values i = base + num through the 12
            print('This is functioning')#Test
            
        avg = avg / 12
        nuclearList.append(avg)#adding values to the list
        num=0
        i = i+12
        
print('This is the Nuclear List Averaged: \n{}'.format(nuclearList))        
        
            
            
            



'''
fig = plt.figure()
fig.add_subplot(111)
plt.scatter(x, nuclearPower)
plt.show()

Tasks:
1)Create your project team. You may have either 3 or 4 members in your team.
  - Tom Brix
  - Kimberly Larson
  - Ryan Smith
  - Michael Wolf

2)Explore the different open data sources and identify them. Create a list.
  - See Open Source Data (1) (2).docx on Master

3)Develop an interesting question that you may frame based on the types of data available.
  Question:
  How have different types of energy increased or decreased throughout the years?  
    -	Possible option: 
      o	Store as var emissions for energy types and plot the CO2 emissions throughout the years
        •	Y: emissions
        •	X: years
      o	Pull another data source to analyze CO2 emissions based on a set population per year (WE HAVE NOT FOUND THIS DATA SOURCE)
        •	Y: emissions
        •	X: years
        •	Plot each data source vs. each other

4)What specific data source(s) would you choose?
  - See Energy.xlsx on Master (from data.gov)
  
5)Read the data source(s) into appropriate DATAFRAME using pandas
  import pandas as pd
  
  engery = pd.read_excel('Energy.xlxs')
  
  df = pd.DataFrame(energy)

       #Refer to code 
  
6)Determine which columns from the source(s) would be used.
  Total Fossil Fuels Consumption
  Nuclear Electric Power Consumption
  Total Renewable Energy Consumption
  Total Primary Energy Consumption
  
  #This is what we are planning on using at the moment (changes may be made at a later time)
  
7)Develop an outline of tasks you will need to do to answer the question.
  #Refer to code

Deliverable:
1)Each of the above tasks has one or more outcomes. Produce a report for each.
2)Create a Github repository for your project. Name it using the last initials of members.
3)Maintain your code (scripts) and documentation in the repository.
